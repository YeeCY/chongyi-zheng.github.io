I am an incoming PhD student in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) advised by [Benjamin Eysenbach](https://ben-eysenbach.github.io/). I have worked on developing <b>reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms</b> that enable long-horizon reasoning using probabilistic inference. I recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering advised by [Ruslan Salakhutdinov](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/). I have had the great opportunity to collaborate with [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/) and work with [Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/).
