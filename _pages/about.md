I am a Master student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) advised by [Benjamin Eysenbach](https://ben-eysenbach.github.io/) and [Ruslan Salakhutdinov](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/). I have worked on developing <b>reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms</b> that enable long-horizon reasoning using probabilistic inference. I have had the great opportunity to collaborate with [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/) and work with [Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/). <b>I'm applying to PhD programs in Fall 2023.</b>
