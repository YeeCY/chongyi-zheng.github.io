I am a Master student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) advised by Professors [Benjamin Eysenbach](https://ben-eysenbach.github.io/) and [Ruslan Salakhutdinov](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/). I am interested in developing <b>reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms</b> that enables long-horizon reasoning using the idea of probabilistic inference. Previously, I was fortunate to be advised by Professors [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/), [Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/), and [Jimmy Ba](https://jimmylba.github.io/).
